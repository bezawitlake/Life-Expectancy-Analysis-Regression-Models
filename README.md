# Life-Expectancy-Analysis-Regression-Models
This repository contains several regression models for analyzing life expectancy. The models were built using Python, with data from the World Health Organization.

# Data
The data used in these models are publicly available from the Kaggle website. The data includes information on various health indicators, such as life expectancy, mortality rates, and disease prevalence, for countries around the world.

# Models
The repository contains several regression models for analyzing life expectancy. These models include:

Linear regression
Polynomial regression
Ridge regression and Ensemble models

there is a separate data preprocessing, visualization, and model-building notebooks.

Results
The results of each model are presented in the repository, including model performance metrics, visualizations of the data, and interpretation of the results. The results are presented in a clear and accessible format, with explanations provided for each step of the analysis.
